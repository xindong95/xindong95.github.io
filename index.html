I received my bachelor's degree in Biotechnology from Shandong Normal University in 2018. My research focuses on elucidating the mechanism of gene regulation and epigenome in cancer genome based on available public data. Recently I am working on developing computational approaches to investigate gene regulation with the power of single-cell technology.
