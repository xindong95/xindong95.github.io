## EDUCATION

**Sep.2018 – Jul.2024**  
Ph.D. in Bioinformatics  
School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, China  
<!-- **Advisors:** Dr. Chenfei Wang & Dr. Xiaole Shirley Liu  -->

B.S. in Biotechnology  
School of Life Sciences, Shandong Normal University, China  

## RESEARCH EXPERIENCES

### Graduate Student, Tongji University (2018-2024)

- Developed and applied computational methods to analyze single-cell and spatial data  
  - Developed [SCRIP (**S**ingle-**C**ell Gene **R**egulation **I**nference using ChI**P**-seq)](https://github.com/wanglabtongji/SCRIP), a method integrating scATAC-seq and bulk TR ChIP-seq to infer single-cell TR activity and targets. SCRIP outperformed motif-based approaches in TR binding activity assessment and enabled identification of TR target genes and construction of single-cell GRNs. It was successfully applied to lineage tracing, cell-type clustering, and cell-type-specific GRN inference in various biological systems. With the advances of single-cell multiomics techniques, we updated it to [SCRIPro](https://github.com/wanglabtongji/SCRIPro), which suits both single-cell and spatial multiomics data.
  - Developed [TISCH (**T**umor **I**mmune **S**ingle **C**ell **H**ub)](http://tisch.compbio.cn) and TISCH2, a curated resource integrating single-cell transcriptome profiles from ~6 million cells across 50 cancer types, enabling systematic comparison of gene expression and immune system heterogeneity to inform immunotherapy research.
<!-- **Advisors:** Dr. Chenfei Wang & Dr. Xiaole Shirley Liu  -->  

- Large-scale genomic data mining and integration analysis  
  - Developed [CHIPS](https://github.com/liulab-dfci/CHIPS), a pipeline that processes epigenome data into readable results with a single command. CHIPS integrates state-of-the-art tools for cistrome NGS data and automates parameter selection. Built on the Snakemake framework, it is easily deployable on cloud or cluster servers.  
  - We developed and maintained the [Cistrome Data Browser](http://cistrome.org/db/#/), which hosts many public cistrome sequence datasets, offering a user-friendly interface to access the data quality and the results of downstream analysis.
