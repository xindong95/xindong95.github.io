Hello there. It took me some spare time to get this website work as I think. After building this website, I decided to write something per week, finally. As a Ph.D. student, my supervisors told us that we should practice writing as early as possible. But it's quite hard to persist with many daily works and tasks. But writing blogs might be a good way to encourage me.  

For blog content, I would like to share my daily life, new technology in biology/bioinformatics, some tricks I met in coding, new digital products I interests, etc. Well, input makes output. I definitely still need to learn and read things as much as possible, which can help me write a lot with good quality. I'll try to update this regularly and continually, hopefully.
